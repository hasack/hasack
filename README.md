### Hello 👋

I've always been intrigued by how things work. It turns out that there's all sorts of things you can do with technology...

The eDisclosure / eDiscovery repos are for having fun at work, the others are just for fun.

A couple of projects to start me off:

🔭 DAT Viewer - WPF application that strips delimiters / control characters from a DAT file and displays the data in an interactive grid.
