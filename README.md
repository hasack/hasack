### Hello 👋

I've always been intrigued by how things work. It turns out that there's all sorts of things you can do with technology...

A couple of projects to start me off:

🚄 Historic Train Performance - WPF application that queries a publicly (once registered) available API endpoint to see whether trains were on time. Includes secure user credential storage and csv export.

🔭 DAT Viewer - WPF application that strips delimiters / control characters from a DAT file and displays the data in an interactive grid.

🔐 Password Generator - Console application using .NET Cryptography library to generate passwords of a requested length and complexity.

🏢 Console Infrastructure Queries - Console application using [Relativity REST APIs](https://platform.relativity.com/) to query infrastructure values.

🔃 Rubiks Cube - library and implementation for solving a 3 x 3 Rubiks Cube.
